# wubzy-site

This is where I store the code for my site. I'm not super good with Nuxt as I'm coming from a raw
JS/HTML/CSS background, so it won't do much for reference yet, but if you wanna take a peek around,
it's here for you to do so :3

## Pages

- Home
> `pages/index.vue`

Where my landing page is. You can find some strong CSS effects and styles used there, 
but really not much to see.

- Theme Generator
> `pages/util/theme.vue`

A crazy amount of components and scripts working together to create a theme generator 
for BetterDiscord by injecting CSS into a theme template.

_Super proud of this one, if I do say so myself_
